# KHW's tex setup

This is (part of) my setup for tex projects.

## Usage

* Run `new name_of_project` to get a new tex project set up
* Add files to `main.tex` (like with `intro.tex` in the default set up)
* Run `make`

You can also compile a single file at a time with `make name_of_file.pdf`
(This is useful for long projects)
